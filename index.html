            Howdy there, the name is Mint Pitassy! 
            And it's a pleasure to be in this class. <br><br>
            Currently, I study Game Design and Interactive Media at the 
            University of Montana. I'm in my senior year, and I plan on
            continuing my education into grad school.<br><br>

            I'm a student at the Davidson Honors College, University of Montana Advocate, eSports Player, <br>
            as well as a Production Assistant at Muteki Games Collective and Prestige Beauty Advisor at<br>
            Ulta Beauty.<br><br>

            My art has been featured and published in juried competitions, and I'm hoping to submit more artwork to shows as time goes on. 
            I love creating games and making art, so I hope to continue that passion forever!

            I remember being 4 years old, eating pizza and sitting on the couch watching my mom play 
            Super Mario Galaxy. I didn't have to worry about classes, or money, what people thought about me or 
            how they perceived me. I was just sitting and watching my mom chase the little starbunny, and everything was okay.
            <br><br>
            Now I'm an adult who worries about all those things. Who has gone through almost 22 years of living and has assumedly "seen everything."
            I feel like I've already seen life and death. Everything the world has to offer, and I find myself dissatisfied.<br><br> "Is this it?" I ask.<br><br> 
            "What more exists in this place?" I ask again and again. <br><br>
            Yet I think about my mom on the first level of Super Mario Galaxy. <br>
            How she chased those starbunnies again and again, and when she finally caught them she could explore the rest of the game's world.<br><br>
            I sit in my room as I type this. I think about my own dissatisfaction. I remember how easy it was when I was a kid, but I also remeber another thing. 
            Perhaps I'm still on the first level, chasing those starbunnies. It's annoying, and grating, and they seem so close yet so far.<br>
            Maybe there's more worlds to discover, and it'll happen when it happens. For now, maybe I should enjoy chasing the starbunnies here. 
            And I will be grateful for the day I catch them and can explore the next world.
