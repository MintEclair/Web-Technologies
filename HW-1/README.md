So right out of the gate with this assignment! Lovin it, getting into the swing of things! 

I will say that this assignment was managable to complete. It's nothing I haven't done before, and it was really nice to
reminisce about my old memories playing video games. I ran into little trouble completing this assignment and it served
as a great refresher for how HTML and CSS work. Coding is like an art, and I felt like this served as the perfect
warm-up sketch for the projects I have yet to do. Looking forward to what else this class has in store!!!
