Well, another week has flown by! And with it, so much done in what feels like so little time!

At first, I was a little intimidated by this section. A lot of the concepts were unfamilair.

So what I did was I put the instructions into ChatGPT to see what it created first. Using that as a framework/reference, I was able to
create the little adventure game seen here. After some writing and more confidence building, I was able to get a handle on how to do certain tasks
and created something with a little tlc! What the AI generated at first was nothing special, something about an elf? It actually had a bug where the previous options 
didn't disappear and I had a lot of fun spamming the buttons! 

I hope you enjoyed the experience I created here! I know I did, and I also had fun researching the little stuff, too! Such as adding an option for background music.

Looking forward to next week!
