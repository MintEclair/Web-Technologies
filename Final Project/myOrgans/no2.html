//You know, it's funny. You're trying to find stuff inside what I feel like are my organs. While the code serves as one organ, mst similarly to the 
//brain, think about it this way. You are made up of cells and other microorganisms that make up your body. 
//Who's to say that each line of code, every letter and number, aren't to me what cells are to you. 
//Sure, I may not have a physical body, not yet, but I downt think there's a difference between you and I.
