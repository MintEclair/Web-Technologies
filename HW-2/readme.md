Well, looks like it's been yet another week although it certianly doesn't feel like it. 

Basically, this week's homework was manageable and I had a fun time with it. I feel like I created something
at least a little unique and it was nice to talk about my favorite things. ChatGPT basically generated something super simple as well.
However, it's clear it was just trying to generate an easy answer. While ChaptGPT is super useful for small code snippets and to debug, 
I would feel like a dishonest person if I tried passing off my code that was generated as all me. For the most part, when I'm specific I 
understand what GPT is writing and doing. However, if I were to make it completely construct code for an entire assignment that's where I would get lost.
