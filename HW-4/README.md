Another week has yet come to a close and with it, more opportunities to learn and grow as a person!

This week was rather fun! I took what I learned previosuly, and applied some of it here while also learning newer, FRESHER, material!
Truth be told, last week I had no idea where to start so I asked the good ol' ChatGPTerino to guide me. It provided a cute little story and I 
used a funny placeholder. 

With that, I was able to fully graps the material. Such as how switch cases allow users to switch between different possibilites or methods. I imagine
search engines probably use something like this on a larger scale based on what I learned. Then, once I understood how it all worked I added my own fun little details into the webpage. Such as colors, font changes, title changes, etc. 

AI is a very powerful learning tool, and with it its only allowed my creativity to flow even better!
