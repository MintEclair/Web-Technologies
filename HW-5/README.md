Another week has flown by! Wowza!

I'll admit, this certainly was a challenge this week. The concepts are coming in hot and ready like a Little Caesar's pizza!
However, with the use of the internet and GhatGPT I was able to make my dreams come true! I used it as another kickoff point and found it does some funny stuff.
It certainly did what I wanted it to do, and it pulled it off very successfully still. I also find it as a good tool cause it tells me how each thing works and where I went wrong with my original coding, too.

Can't wait to complete this cute little memory game next week!
